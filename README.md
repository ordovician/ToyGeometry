# Toy Geometry

A toy version of a geometry library made for book "Julia as a Second Language," as a demonstration of how you make a package, deal with modules and environments in Julia.

There is actually no real dependency on `Dates` and `Base64`. They have just been added as dependencies to demonstrate how dependencies get recorded in the `Project.toml` and `Manifest.toml` files.
